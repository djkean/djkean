#### Hi, My name's Dennis
I am a Software Developer & Student with [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca).
I began my journey into software development in 2021, and since then I've created a handful of projects that helped me express ideas that have been fun, engaging, whimsical, educational and analytical. Something great that I appreciate about coding is having the toolset to entertain projects whether there is an educational motivation to learn an interesting language or framework, or just because you find an idea fun! 

I am currently putting the finishing touches on my latest project, where I undertook learning NodeJS, SQL, and ChakraUI - PokeOne LootLogger (P1LL) - [Repo found here](https://github.com/djkean/P1LootLogger) - Which couples the interest in educating myself in backend technologies along with the fun and satisfaction of developing a tool for my friends and I to use involving one of our common interests. It is a unique and rewarding experience in which I hope to share it's completion soon!

#### Some interesting features to look forward to:
- Selfmade account & login system
- SQL schema & tables for recording data
- Automated mailing system
- Use of Json web tokens
- Statistics collected and graphed


In the near future, I look forward to sharing new projects and adventures!

Some new technologies I look forward to learning are:
- TypeScript
- Svelte
- Tailwind
